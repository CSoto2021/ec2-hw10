In this project, we are using the student server expressjs file we worked with last project to create webpages 
that allow us to interact with the API's functionality. We will be creating multiple basic HTMl webpages, each webpage dedicated
to its own simple function such as adding a student to the data file, deleting students, or displaying a students information
to the screen. After every function is succesfully executed, the webpage should inform the user that the action was a success,
and the effects should be visible in the JSON folder.
